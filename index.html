            <h4 class="section-title" id="website-meaning">Website Meaning</h4>
            <p>
                A website is a collection of related pages written in computer languages such as HTML, PHP,
                XHTML, Javascript etc which are identified by a common domain and published on at least one server. 
                Examples of websites are Facebook which is identified by a domain name 
                'facebook.com' and Necta which is identified by a domain name 'necta.go.tz'.

            <h4 class="section-title" id="website-significance">Website Significance</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li class="para-title-content">Branding your business</li>
                    <p>Having a website makes it very easy for people to find you, read up about your company, discover what you do, and answer a bunch of questions they have on your business. By having a website people will be able 
                      to find your company when they search for your company on a search engine like Google, Yahoo or Bing.</p>
                    <p>Showcasing your brand to your prospective customers is one of the most important things that you can do. By clearly establishing who you are, what you 
                      represent and what you stand for, you increase the chances of your customers buying from you.
                      <p>This is also something that can set you apart from your competitors. Without a website, it can be incredibly challenging to do this because people can't easily find quality and reliable information on your business.</p>

                    <li class="para-title-content">Establish credibility and build trust</li>
                    <p>One of the main reasons you should have a website for your business is to increase your organization's credibility. Chances are there are several providers offering a similar service to yours. One way you can 
                      stand out is by having a website that looks good and clearly communicates quality information to your consumers
                    </p>
            
                    <li class="para-title-content">Saving You Time + Customer Service</li>
                    <p>Many businesses get calls from prospects or existing customers asking simple questions about location and hours of operation. If you miss a call, the customer is left unhappy. Calls can also distract 
                      your staff from focusing on the most important parts of your business. A website can reduce these calls and increase internal productivity. At the same time, it helps customers find useful information without needing to 
                      call, which ultimately provides an all-around better user experience.
                    </p>
            
                    <li class="para-title-content">24/7 Online Presence</li>
                    <p>One of the major advantages of having a website is that it is accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Even during non-business hours, customers can access your website and avail your services or get the 
                      information they need, which is one of the key elements in the importance of a website in business. The website is always at work to ensure that customers who come in are always served in the comfort of their homes.
